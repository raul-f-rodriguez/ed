      <h2>14-20 April 1862</h2>
      <p>On Monday, 14 April 1862, Amherst College acquired a canon from the Battle of New Bern – one of the many battles of the American Civil War – and dedicated it to Frazar Stearns who was slain in combat.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://www.amherst.edu/news/news_releases/2012/03/node/384752" style="text-decoration: none;">1</a>–<a href="http://www.classroomelectric.org/volume2/werner/LBapr15page2T.html" style="text-decoration: none;">2</a></sup> He was the son of the College’s fourth president and a friend of William Austin Dickinson. The Springfield Daily Republican covered the event. Meanwhile, the Battle of Fort Pillow took a turn for the better when Union troops retook the fort and minded casualties.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/remember-fort-pillow/?_r=0" style="text-decoration: none;">3</a></sup><br>
      <br>
      The New York Times published an article on this day harping on the difficulties of burying casualties of the War in Pittsburgh.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://civilwargazette.wordpress.com/2009/04/" style="text-decoration: none;">4</a></sup> The 16th President of the United States of American, Abraham Lincoln, abolished slavery in the District of Columbia on 16 April 1862. The Bill freed an estimated 700,000 persons and gave slave owners of freed slaves one million dollars in compensation.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/17/news/important-washington-abolition-slavery-district-columbia-bill-for-that-purpose.html" style="text-decoration: none;">5</a>–<a href="http://www.historyplace.com/specials/calendar/april.htm" style="text-decoration: none;">6</a></sup> The New York Times ran a piece on the Bill that was signed by President Lincoln himself.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/17/news/important-washington-abolition-slavery-district-columbia-bill-for-that-purpose.html" style="text-decoration: none;">7</a></sup><br>
      <br>
      On this same day, the American Confederate Congress passed the first Conscription Act, which allowed white males between the ages of 18 and 35 to be drafted into military service.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/twenty-slave_law" style="text-decoration: none;">8</a></sup> Friday, 18 April 1862, saw the beginning of the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=UIkWZDWSzPYC&pg=PT27&lpg=PT27&dq=Battle+of+Forts+Jackson+and+St.+Philip+archive&source=bl&ots=gM7o1wkSKz&sig=ijkJUs5pRIGs0XMsfBsZcdL9U_A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwir68Xb4snSAhUmzIMKHeQnD4sQ6AEIYjAO#v=onepage&q=Battle%20of%20Forts%20Jackson%20and%20St.%20Philip%20archive&f=false" style="text-decoration: none;">9</a>–<a href="http://www.onthisday.com/date/1862/april/18" style="text-decoration: none;">10</a></sup> The impetus of the Battle was to take back possession of New Orleans, which the Union Army did not accomplish until 28 April 1862. Also of interest on 18 April 1862 was a New York Times article that discussed the amputation of Capt. W. H. Polk’s leg and, more generally, the Battle of Shiloh.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/17/news/important-washington-abolition-slavery-district-columbia-bill-for-that-purpose.html" style="text-decoration: none;">4</a></sup></p>

        MR. HIGGINSON,–Are you too deeply occupied to say if my verse is alive?<br>

        The mind is so near itself it cannot see distinctly, and I have none to ask.<br>
        <br>
        Should you think it breathed, and had you the leisure to tell me, I should feel quick gratitude.<br>

        <br>
        I inclose my name, asking you, if you please, sir, to tell me what is true?<br>
        <br>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Emily Dickinson began her correspondence with Thomas Wentworth Higginson on Tuesday, 15 April 1862.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.classroomelectric.org/volume1/belasco/dickinson-higginson.htm" style="text-decoration: none;">11</a></sup> She seemed to be responding directly to his Letter to a Young Contributor, inasmuch as she use adopted and subverting some of his diction (i.e. “[a]re you too deeply occupied to say if my Verse is alive?”).<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1891/10/emily-dickinsons-letters/306524/" style="text-decoration: none;">12</a></sup> Higginson apparently received the letter the following day. “On April 16, 1862, I took [Emily Dickinson’s letter of the previous day] from the post office," Higginson states, "it was in a handwriting so peculiar that it seemed as if the writer might have taken her first lessons by studying the famous fossil bird-tracks in the museum of that college town [Amherst].”<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1891/10/emily-dickinsons-letters/306524/" style="text-decoration: none;">12</a></sup> The letter contained four poems and a small envelope with the line “Are you too deeply occupied to say if my Verse is alive?"<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1891/10/emily-dickinsons-letters/306524/" style="text-decoration: none;">12</a></sup><br>
      <br>
      Brenda Wineapple, in her book White Heat, gets this date wrong, however, as she says that Higginon received the letter on 17 April 1862 “where he had stopped on the mild spring morning of April 17 after watching young women lift dumbbells at the local gymnasium,” when Higginson himself says in the Atlantic that he received them on 16 April 1862.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94235765" style="text-decoration: none;">13</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1891/10/emily-dickinsons-letters/306524/" style="text-decoration: none;">12</a></sup> But I could be wrong, as it may be that one of Dickinson’s letters to Higginson is missing, as, two later, on 18 April 1862, Higginson writes to his mother and alludes to more than one letter.<br>
      <br>
      He writes, “[s]ince that Letter to a Young Contributor I have more wonderful effusions than ever sent me to read with request for advice, which is hard to give. Louise [Higginon’s sister] was quite overwhelmed with two which came in two successive days.”<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=odjIKZKYHJQC&pg=PA544&lpg=PA544&dq=emily+dickinson+april+18+1862&source=bl&ots=Z4wBLmVnte&sig=QBtPQNICqzhlTaMmONWUIbdlEq0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjygoTs2rvSAhUFORQKHQE1BQgQ6AEIOTAE" style="text-decoration: none;">14</a></sup> But Higginson complicates matter further in the preface to The Complete Poems (1962) when he called 19 April 1862, “the day when Higginson a letter form Dickinson with four of her poems enclosed[,] one of “three significant dates in[nineteenth-century] American literary history.”<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AtT-uDbbqG8C&pg=PA483&lpg=PA483&dq=higginson+april+19+1862&source=bl&ots=jwkV1pn5BN&sig=FS678Yo3cJ11C6kFPyCzlTZHFEo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNhLLl7snSAhXoxYMKHTm0AG0Q6AEILzAD#v=onepage&q=higginson%20april%2019%20186" style="text-decoration: none;">15-16</a></sup> Whenever Dickinson sent her letter to Higginson (and whenever he received it), it could be implied that the week of 14 April 1862 to 20 April 1862 was the week that Dickinson had her poetic debutante.</sup></p>
      <p>Having the contexts materially enriched my experience of the poetic events. Reading about the horrific events of the Civil War helped me to see allusions to such atrocities in Dickinson’s poems, which further weakens the autonomous author paradigm. I was surprised to see how politically charged some of Dickinson’s poems could be. From "The Malay – took the Pearl –[F451]" potentially critiquing the nobility and highlighting the selflessness of slaves, to "It was given to me by the Gods –[F455]" poking fun at capitalism, one could see that Dickinson was not cognizant of political events like Betsy Erkkila postulates in her paper “Emily Dickinson and Class."<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/489934" style="text-decoration: none;">17</a></sup><br>
      <br>
      I am not sure whether I was able to develop an original approach to the poems, as it was hard to read the poems with fresh eyes after reading through their corresponding scholarship, that is, assuming it was available, which was not always the case. Furthermore, reading about the contemporary events made me want to see these events reflected in Dickinson’s poetry, which could have given me a biased reading of the poem. Nonetheless, I think reading about the contemporary events and the scholarship gave a more broader sense of the poem than if I would have read it in isolation. After all, Dickinson’s poems do not exist in a vacuum. It was satisfying to create my own sort of fascicle by deciding how to present the poems and my findings aesthetically and I truly enjoyed choosing poems around a theme rather than a linear notion of time.<br>
      <br>
      It was frustrating, however, to see how some events in Dickinson’s life are inconclusive, though presented as conclusive. The day Higginson received Dickinson’s first letter, for example, is not agreed upon by everyone. Other than this, however, I didn’t have too many other frustrations other than locating archives that gave free access to students. I think what should be included in this process is a way for people to contribute other important events and information to the things that were happening. It is kind of scary feeling responsible to find every event that happened on each day, when you know that other people could have different experiences. As such, there should be away to signal that these dates are tentative and could be improved upon by users themselves. This is the only thing that I felt got left out. Otherwise, I had a fun experience.</p><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder='0' height='650' src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1Hbu2dpbMCtNSnTrErE5Cc15YZDSd2zxoru3-i3YYCCo&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%'></iframe>

      <h2>MONDAY</h2>
      <p>In the first two stanzas, the speaker seems to apologetic for their existence. They are apparently aware of soldiers being killed in the war, sacrificing themselves for the freedom of others. The speaker goes on the question whether these men deserve their fate how it is justified. By the last stanza, the poet speaker praises the “Men” as “Saviors” who “Present Divinity.”</p>
      <blockquote>
        It feels a shame to be Alive–<br>
        When Men so brave—are dead—<br>
        One envies the Distinguished Dust—<br>
        Permitted—such a Head—<br>
        <br>
        The Stone—that tells defending Whom<br>
        This Spartan put away<br>
        What little of Him we—possessed<br>
        In Pawn for Liberty—<br>
        <br>
        The price is great—Sublimely paid—<br>
        Do we deserve—a Thing—<br>
        That lives—like Dollars—must be piled<br>
        Before we may obtain?<br>
        <br>
        Are we that wait—sufficient worth—<br>
        That such Enormous Pearl<br>
        As life—dissolved be—for Us—<br>
        In Battle's—horrid Bowl?<br>
        <br>
        It may be—a Renown to live—<br>
        I think the Man who die—<br>
        Those unsustained—Saviors—<br>
        Present Divinity—
      </blockquote>
      <p>Helen Vendler, A. Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University, interprets the poem as “a meditation on justice.”<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674048676" style="text-decoration: none;">18</a></sup> She thinks that Dickinson is raising the question “do the citizens at home deserve the sacrifice made by the dead,” which the third stanza makes manifest: “Do we deserve – a Thing – / That lives – like Dollars – must be piled / Before we may obtain.”<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674048676" style="text-decoration: none;">18</a></sup> Aside from Vendler’s book, there is not much scholarship on “It feels a shame to be Alive–, [F524]” though Dorothy Huff Oberhaus, Professor of English at Mercy College, cited it in a letter to the editors of the New York Review of Books as a testament to Dickinson’s awareness of the Civil War.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2000/08/10/dickinsons-civil-war/" style="text-decoration: none;">19</a></sup> These findings contribute to the autonomous author paradigm debate surrounding Dickinson by suggesting that she her world view was not limited to her abode. In my opinion, this poem could be seen as a response to Stearns' death, as it possible that Dickinson would have attended his canon ceremony at Amherst College.</p>

      <h2>Tuesday</h2>
      <p>The speaker begins by acknowledging the pleasure they received when “Sweet” gave them recognition. It was a “Days among,” presumable because they showed the speaker that they “could be mighty, if [they] … liked.” The second stanza turns the day into a “Jewel” that “Glows Central.” By the concluding sentence, the poet speaker says that the day is the “Vaster – of the World’s,” perhaps because of the enthusiasm she received from “Sweet”’s encouragement.</p>
      <blockquote>
        That first Day, when you praised Me, Sweet,<br>
        And said that I was strong —<br>
        And could be mighty, if I liked —<br>
        That Day — the Days among —<br>
        <br>
        Glows Central — like a Jewel<br>
        Between Diverging Golds —<br>
        The Minor One — that gleamed behind —<br>
        And Vaster — of the World's.
      </blockquote>
      <p>I am quite shocked at the lack of scholarship on this poem. It could be read as a direct response to Higginson’s letter. He tells her to take “one or two years” to develop her craft, which is exactly what she did in 1862. Additionally, he offered her direct advice that could have encouraged her to continue in her craft. It could have been that the letter made it all the more clearer to Dickinson that he was speaking to her. He referenced her “urgent epistles” and very feminine handwriting. These could be praises. He even says “[h]ow few men in all the pride of culture can emulate the easy grace of a bright woman's letter [and] [d]o not emulate 'paper-sparing Pope,'" whose chaotic manuscript of the "Iliad," written chiefly on the backs of old letters,” which is just what she did.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/11115" style="text-decoration: none;">20</a></sup> As such, this could also be satirical poem about the power Higginson thought he had over her and how much he actually did not.</p>

      <h2>Wednesday</h2>
      <p>In the first stanza, the speaker seems to be chasing a heaven. The heaven invites this chasing, but is impossible to reach. It “[d]ips–evades–teases–deploys” before receeding to the sky. The speaker feels that the sky is a “mocking sky.” That the clouds are not just clouds, but, “Royal clouds” speaks to the disconnect that the speaker feels with this entity. The speaker is time and again chasing it and viewing it from below. The second stanza complicates matters further. The speaker longs for a “Honey” that is produced by a bee that does not flee. What to make of this.</p>
      <blockquote>
        The nearest Dream recedes—unrealized—<br>
        The Heaven we chase,<br>
        Like the June Bee—before the School Boy,<br>
        Invites the Race—<br>

        Staring—bewildered—at the mocking sky –<br>

        Homesick for steadfast Honey—<br>

      <p>This poem was sent to Higginson. According to him “it is among the most exquisite of her [Dickinson’s] productions, with a singular felicity of phrase and an aerial lift that bears the ear upward with the bee it traces."<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://emilydickinsonmuseum.org/writing_assignments" style="text-decoration: none;">21</a></sup> Higginson sees the poem as a joyful verse that brings the speaker to a heavenly state of mind. Elizabeth A. Petrino, on the other hand, says that the poem could be seen as Dickinson foreseeing Higginson’s interpretation of her poetry. Per Petrino, “[w]hether or not Dickinson intended to show her awareness that Higginson might not understand her poetry, he admits his confusion at her cryptic metaphors.”<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://thereaderonline.co.uk/2015/03/09/featured-poem-it-was-given-to-me-by-the-gods-by-emily-dickinson/" style="text-decoration: none;">22</a></sup></p>

      <h2>Thursday</h2>
      <p>In one stanza, the poet acknowledges some “[i]t” that they received form a divine presence. The speaker “never put it down” because they were afraid of losing “it,” which suggests that they valued “it.” But the value that the placed on it was anything but monetary. They say that it made them “Rich,” though not in a materialistic sense like “Gold” would. The “it” essentially makes the poet different and, more importantly, “bold.”</p>
      <blockquote>
        It was given to me by the Gods —<br>
        When I was a little Girl —<br>
        They give us Presents most — you know —<br>
        When we are new — and small.<br>
        I kept it in my Hand —<br>
        I never put it down —<br>
        I did not dare to eat — or sleep —<br>
        For fear it would be gone —<br>
        I heard such words as "Rich" —<br>
        When hurrying to school —<br>
        From lips at Corners of the Streets —<br>
        And wrestled with a smile.<br>
        Rich! 'Twas Myself — was rich —<br>
        To take the name of Gold —<br>
        And Gold to own — in solid Bars —<br>
        The Difference — made me bold —

      <p>There is not much scholarship on this poem, though the Emily Dickinson Museum uses it in a prompt, asking how it “can make a powerful connection with students about the power of their own gifts and talents.”<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://emilydickinsonmuseum.org/writing_assignments" style="text-decoration: none;">23</a></sup> In a post on The Reader Online, Lisa Spurgin cited the poem to celebrate International Women’s Day. “As the theme of this year’s International Women’s Day is ‘Make It Happen’, the final few lines surely give any of us the spark of self-belief needed to go forth and make our voices heard and our deeds recognized” she said.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://thereaderonline.co.uk/2015/03/09/featured-poem-it-was-given-to-me-by-the-gods-by-emily-dickinson/" style="text-decoration: none;">24</a></sup> Both of these readings see the poem as a call to embrace one’s talents, which has resonances today.</p>

      <h2>Friday</h2>
      <p>The opening stanza suggests that the speaker is in a state of intense passion. As the poem goes on, one could get the sense that the “Light” that the speaker is emitting is imperfect. It must be refined with “Hammers, and with Blaze” until “[r]epudiates” some “Forge.” There seems to be some irrepressible passion that the speaker has that urges them to act as a “Blacksmith” and to make something of it.</p>
      <blockquote>
        Dare you see a Soul at the "White Heat"?<br>
        Then crouch within the door—<br>
        Red—is the Fire’s common tint—<br>
        But when the vivid Ore<br>
        <br>
        Has vanquished Flame’s conditions—<br>
        It quivers from the Forge<br>
        Without a color, but the Light<br>
        Of unannointed Blaze—<br>
        <br>
        Least Village, boasts its Blacksmith—<br>
        Whose Anvil’s even ring<br>
        Stands symbol for the finer Forge<br>
        That soundless tugs—within—<br>
        <br>
        Refining these impatient Ores<br>
        With Hammers, and with Blaze<br>
        Until the designated Light<br>
        Repudiate the Forge—
      </blockquote>
      <p>There has been too much scholarship to elucidate in a short summary to do this poem justice. Several books have been made for this poem – Soul at the White Heat by Joyce Carol Oates and Chapter 23 in Martha Nell Smith and Mary Loeffelholz’s A Companion to Emily Dickinson chief among them – as well as copious amounts of scholarly articles.<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1343529" style="text-decoration: none;">23</a></sup><sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;">-</sup><sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405122803.html" style="text-decoration: none;">24</a></sup> As a starting point consider what Richard B.

      <h2>Saturday</h2>
      <p>The poet speaker identifies themselves as an “Earl,” which, according to the Emily Dickinson Lexicon, could mean any of the following: “[n]obleman; man with a title in British nobility; male person having the rank below a marquis and above a viscount. They cannot enter the see because it is not sanctified and so the “Malay” is the one who gets the “Pearl.” The speaker’s depiction of the “Malay” seems to hinge on negativity. The “Malay” is at both times “Dusky” and “Negro” who does not value the pearl as much as the “Earl” would.</p>
      <blockquote>
        The Malay—took the Pearl—<br>
        Not—I—the Earl—<br>
        I—feared the Sea—too much<br>
        Unsanctified—to touch—<br>
        <br>
        Praying that I might be<br>
        Worthy—the Destiny—<br>
        The Swarthy fellow swam—<br>
        And bore my Jewel—Home—<br>
        <br>
        Home to the Hut! What lot<br>
        Had I—the Jewel—got—<br>
        Borne on a Dusky Breast—<br>
        I had not deemed a Vest<br>
        Of Amber—fit—<br>
        <br>
        The Negro never knew<br>
        I—wooed it—too—<br>
        To gain, or be undone—<br>
        Alike to Him—One—<br>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Ken Takata, an Associate Professor at Hamline University, gave a talk at the Emily Dickinson International Society 2013 Conference Abstracts for Presentations in which he discussed the poems relation to “race as well as class, rank, privilege, wealth, and nationality.”<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="http://www.emilydickinsoninternationalsociety.org/node/423" style="text-decoration: none;">26</a></sup> But his talked focused on the ambiguity of the poem and how it gave readers several ways to assemble its sentences. Paula Bernat Bennett, Professor Emerita of English at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, does not see the poem as a Dickinson poem. She sees it as “a nineteenth-century text, one of many texts in which the denigration of people of color is treated so casually one barely registers it's there."<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236726134_The_Negro_never_knew_Emily_Dickinson_and_Racial_Typology_in_the_Nineteenth_Century" style="text-decoration: none;">27</a></sup> Both Takata and Bennett suggest that the poem could be read as a response to contemporary eighteenth century racial and social injustices. Here is where Christian Miller diverges in his analysis. “The focus [the poem] has been Dickinson’s views of slavery and on racism against African Americans … [but] [t]he Asian content of the poem is all but ignored."<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xUcY55nJx1kC&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=The+focus+has+been+Dickinson%E2%80%99s+views+of+slavery+and+on+racism+against+African&source=bl&ots=0sq-6uVCa9&sig=jjfDGMd4uxS6AReLzSIH8FQzZqY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiztrDox83SAhXl7IMKHS4iDY0Q6AEINTAE" style="text-decoration: none;">28</a></sup> Ultimately, Miller suggests that the poem could be read as an oriental tale.</p>

      <h2>Sunday</h2>
      <p>This poem has a similar structure to "The nearest Dream recedes – unrealized –[F304]", and deals with a similar sense of searching. The difference here is that the thing that the speaker seeks to find “is dead.” Throughout the first stanza, the speaker alludes to “[y]ou” to question “[w]hich is wiser,” after which they ask why “you” do not ask the “low Ground” if they are “Conscious.” The second stanza, like also like "The nearest Dream recedes – unrealized –[F304]," does not immediately flow with the first stanza. It ends on an off note which creates a sense of unsettlement. They speak about homesickness, but says that those who experience it are “dumb.” This is an example of a poem that resists interpretation, which could explain why there is a lack of scholarship on it.</p>
      <blockquote>
        Is it dead—Find it—<br>
        Out of sound—Out of sight—<br>
        “Happy”? Which is wiser—<br>
        You, or the Wind?<br>
        “Conscious”? Won’t you ask that—<br>
        Of the low Ground?<br>
        <br>
        “Homesick”? Many met it—<br>
        Even through them—This<br>
        Cannot testify—<br>
        Themself—as dumb—<br>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Nonetheless, Christian Miller briefly touches on the poem. “Fascicle 15 exemplifies the terms in which the phenomenon of paring … is significant … losing a lover – and therefore only having him speculatively – is unbearable (“It is dead – Find it –“ [F434]).”<sup style="font-size: 70%;vertical-align: super;"><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9gTzwaN2MtMC&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151&dq=it+is+dead+-+find+it+dickinson&source=bl&ots=WkY32YZw0w&sig=u2POF3akeIgA_iZhyTObekIbxa4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi2hZe6isjSAhUC2BoKHcCwAOg4ChDoAQguMAQ" style="text-decoration: none;">28</a></sup> Miller’s reading of the poem suggests a more traditional, heteronormative reading of the poem, though other readings are certainly possible. More scholarship is needed to explore the full scope of possible interpretations that this poem could generate.</p>
